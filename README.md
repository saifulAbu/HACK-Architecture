# HACK-Architecture
A computer architecture provides a way so that a set of instructions can be executed. An architecture defines meaning of instructions. To implement an architecture, I needed components such as ALU, Program Counter, RAM, Registers so an and so forth. I have made all the components from the scratch only using 1 bit NAND gate and 1 bit D-Flip-Flop following specification from the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686). The following project is [HACK Assembler](https://github.com/saifulAbu/Assembler).

To understand and run the project, reader needs to read the book mentioned above.
